## Description

This repository comprises various modules built with Spring Boot. All configurations are in java classes, I have put up comments at places to help users understand what is the use of a configuration/file.


## Project Structure
A project fulfilling an end to end functionality is divided into 3 main sections (module):

 - **web**: containing all files needed for view, ex: Spring web mvc configuration files, js, jsp and css files.
 - **integration**: containing APIs used by web modules to access backend services, ex: end-points, DTOs and converters
 - **domain**: containing domain, repository and service classes.
